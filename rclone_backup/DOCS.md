# Rclone Backup

Backup your Home Assistant configuration or backups to over [40 cloud providers](https://rclone.org/#providers) using [Rclone](https://rclone.org/).

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: Sync Daily Backups
    schedule: 10 4 * * *
    command: sync
    sources:
      - /backup
    destination: 'google:/Backup/Home Assistant'
    include:
      - DailyBackup*
    exclude: []
    flags: {}
dry_run: false
config_path: /homeassistant/rclone.conf
```

## Configuration

**Option:** `jobs`

A list of jobs to schedule, see the [job config](#job-config) section for a list of available options.

**Option:** `flags`

Global map of flags to give the rclone command for every job, see [rclone flags](https://rclone.org/flags). Underscores are allowed for the flags and they will be replaced with dashes.

```yaml
jobs:
  - ...
flags:
  drive-use-trash: false
  min-age: 30d
```

*For example, you may want to add `drive-use-trash: false` when using google drive so rclone immediately deletes files instead of sending them to the trash.*

**Option:** `extra_flags`

List of flags to give the rclone command, applied globally to all jobs. For use when `flags` option isn't working, the list of flags are appended directly to the rclone command.

```yaml
jobs:
  - ...
extra_flags:
  - --drive-use-trash=false
  - --min-age=30d
```

**Option:** `dry_run`

Trial run with no permanent changes, see what rclone would do without actually doing it.

**Option:** `run_once`

Will run all jobs with no schedule defined immediately then exit. Designed for use with the `hassio.addon_restart` service to trigger jobs.

**Option:** `config_path`

The location of the rclone config file, must be stored under `/config`.

**Option:** `rclone_config`

This allows you to specify the rclone config from within the addon configuration, defining it will take precedence over the `config_path` option.

```yaml
jobs:
  - ...
rclone_config: |
  [google]
  type = drive
  scope = drive
  token = REDACTED
  use_trash = false
```

**Option:** `no_rename`

Disable the renaming of backups before uploading them, with this enabled backups will use their slug id (their name on disk) instead of their friendly name.

**Option:** `no_unrename`

Prevents renaming backups back to their original name, with this enabled the backup files will be renamed to use their friendly name and this will persist on disk.

*Note: this option can apparently cause issues with restoring backups through the WebUI, however, selecting **⋮** → **Reload** should fix it. 
This won't affect the actual integrity of the backups.*

**Option:** `no_slugify`

This will disable the slugification of backup names. This means the **user** is responsible for ensuring their backup names are **valid** filenames for their filesystem and the destination filesystem.

**Option:** `no_events`

Disable sending completion and failure events to Home Assistant.

## Job Config

**Option:** `sources`

List of source locations in the format `remote:path` or for local paths just `path`, e.g. `/backup`, `/config`, `/share`, `/ssl`, `/media`.

**Option:** `source`

A slightly cleaner way to specify a single source, this option will override the `sources` option.

**Option:** `destinations`

A list of locations to write to in the format `remote:path` or for local paths just `path`, see [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs).

**Option:** `destination`

A slightly cleaner way to specify a single destination, this option will override the `destinations` option.

> **Multiple Sources**
>
> When there are multiple sources each source will be backed-up to the destination under `destination/source`
> otherwise they will be directly under `destination`.
>
> **Multiple Destinations**
>
> All sources are backed-up to each destination following the rules for multiple sources mentioned above.

**Option:** `name`

Optionally you can provide a friendly name for the job, this can be useful to identify which job is being run when you have multiple.

**Option:** `schedule`

Specify when the rclone backup should run using cron syntax. If the `schedule` option is empty or undefined the job will be run when the addon starts. If the job should be executed every minute (`* * * * *`), then the cron syntax may need to be enclosed in quotation marks, e. g. `schedule: "* * * * *"`.

**Option:** `command`

The rclone command to run e.g. `sync`, `copy`, `move`.

**Option:** `include`

List of files or folders to include, see [rclone filtering](https://rclone.org/filtering).

*Note: these filters are matching the backups name on the filesystem, if you have not disabled renaming then this will be a slugified version of the backups name, this will effectively replace all special characters with an `_` and remove duplicate underscores.*

To preview the slugified names of your backups you can add a startup job like the following.

```yaml
jobs:
  - command: ls
    name: List Local Backups
    sources:
      - /backup
```

**Option:** `exclude`

List of files or folders to exclude, see [rclone filtering](https://rclone.org/filtering).

**Option:** `flags`

Map of flags to give to the rclone command, see [rclone flags](https://rclone.org/flags).

**Option:** `extra_flags`

List of flags to give the rclone command, applied globally to all jobs. For use when `flags` option isn't working, the list of flags are appended directly to the rclone command.

### Configuring Rclone Remotes

The addon now supports ingress and the Rclone Web UI, you can access this by clicking the **Open Web UI** button in the addon info panel. You do not need a username or password and can just click the login button. Then you can click **Configs** -> **Create new config** to create a new remote.

For more information, or to configure rclone without using the WebUI, you can consult the [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs/). The rclone config can be found at `/config/rclone.conf` by default.

## Events

The addon will fire events using Home Assistant's event bus whenever a job is completed or fails.

**Event:** `rclone_backup.job_successful`

**Event:** `rclone_backup.job_failed`

# Rclone Backup
Backup your Home Assistant configuration or backups to over [70 cloud providers](https://rclone.org/#providers) using [Rclone](https://rclone.org/).

This pairs well with the custom integration [Auto Backup](https://github.com/jcwillox/hass-auto-backup) which provides a highly configurable way to create backups and have them deleted after a given period.

Rclone Backup can sync specific backups, e.g. backups starting with `AutoBackup*` to a cloud provider, and when that backup is deleted from Home Assistant it will be removed from the cloud provider as well.

You can also directly sync your Home Configuration e.g. `/config`, `/share`, `/ssl`, `/media` to a cloud service or to another machine using SFTP. Rclone is smart and will only upload changed files.

The addon also supports monitoring rclone and configuring or exploring remotes through [rclone-webui-react](https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).

## Example

Rclone is a powerful tool, you could for example use the `crypt` and `googledrive` remotes to automatically encrypt your backups and upload them to google drive.

**`rclone.conf`**

```ini
[google]
type = drive
scope = drive
token = REDACTED
; immediately delete backups instead of sending them to the trash
use_trash = false

[hassbackup]
type = crypt
remote = google:Backup/Home Assistant
filename_encryption = off
directory_name_encryption = false
password = REDACTED
password2 = REDACTED
```

**Addon configuration**

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: Sync Daily Backups
    schedule: 10 4 * * *
    command: sync
    sources:
      - /backup
    destination: 'hassbackup:'
    include:
      - DailyBackup*
    exclude: []
    # we can also disable google drive trash using flags
    flags:
      drive-use-trash: false
dry_run: false
config_path: /config/rclone.conf
```
